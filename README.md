# kKanz-ul-Iman  english


A simple attempt to scrape english verison of "This English version of the Holy Quran is the translation of Kanz-ul-Iman the Urdu version of Imam Ahl-e-Sunnat Maulana Shah Ahmed Raza Khan" 
that has been scrapped from ahadees.com website.

There is no current version of a developer friendly english version of "kanzul iman" which can be used by developers of quran apps for example.

The idea is that we can get the entire quran in a json form so that developers can  integrate it as they wish.


I take no responsibility of any additions or editorializing any titles. All data is received as is.

i will store the original scrapped data in txt files with surah:verse in 1.1 filename so that if anyone wants to use the data in any other form, they can do so. 

Please feel free to submit PRs and any corrections.
